    <h2 >What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,  paper or in other media.</li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">CSS is not neccesary </span><span style="font-size: 2vw;"> <mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark></span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;  font-style:oblique;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 >CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element ub the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS  is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However <mark> this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark> because this is easier to  demonstrate, and easirefor you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID the difference is that  CSS class applies a style to multiple elements ID,on  the other hand,applies a style to one unique elemenmtn ID also  special in that  you can URL  to  link  directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
